# hello-world
My valiant attempt to learn as much as I can about this big new world.

My name is Sean.

I'm working on trying to understand this whole Git thing, along with the website/service called GitHub. I'm working on learning some web development skills. I began learning HTML when I was in my teens and gained a decent enough understanding of the language to allow me to manipulate websites and easily pass some basic web coding classes in school.

I'm not entirely sure where I want this to lead just yet. Frankly, I feel I may have _no idea_ what I'm trying to accomplish here just yet, but I feel motivated to keep going, so that's what I'm going to do.

At the very least I can fill my brain with some new knowledge, and that's never a bad thing.
